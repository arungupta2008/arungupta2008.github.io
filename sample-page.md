>   Hi there! I am Arun Kumar Gupta. You know what is the meaning of &#8220;Arun&#8221;, in Indian mythology &#8220;Arunodaya&#8221; means starting of the day and &#8220;Arun &#8211; Kaal&#8221; means dawn. I live in Ahmedabad.

>   In about Me, I would say, I love to go office on Saturdays as well as on Sundays if I don&#8217;t have some dirty clothes back to my room to wash :(, for this i have two reasons.<br /> First Internet speed ðŸ˜€ (B&#8217;coz no one in the office is using internet except me on Sat or Sun :D).<br /> Second I love to learn new things even though they are not relevant to my career n all I get a place to brain-storm, I don&#8217;t care about career, I only care about my passion about learning. You won&#8217;t believe that I don&#8217;t take rest, I need something to do all the time. It may be anything like watching movies, reading paper or doing coding and yes also learning new things. Currently besides my boring job I am contributing on two open source projects <a href="https://github.com/arungupta2008/RegextoWord" target="_blank">Regextoword [1]</a> and <a href="http://freedcs.sourceforge.net/index.html" target="_blank">FreeCDS [2]</a>,Â it&#8217;s my interesting Job after office :(. Â Frankly speaking I&#8217;m looking for a job where I can satisfy my curiosity, my passion, my love.

>   Besides this technical job, I am a social worker too, we (me and my friend Abhi and Boscy D) started a school <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Shlokafoundation" target="_blank">&#8220;Shloka Foundation&#8221;</a> for underprivileged students, these children&#8217;s life is like hell, they don&#8217;t even have anything to wear, they are just like sorry!! I regret to say word &#8220;animals&#8221;, they don&#8217;t know how to live life, and we are at top of our human era, so ridiculous. It&#8217;s been seven months since we started this, now after too much struggling to convince their parents, we sent 16 students to Municipal School (Vastrapur Ahmedabad), our struggle didn&#8217;t end yet. We used to go to our so called &#8220;Mobile&#8221; school on Sunday(8-10am) and Wednesday (8-9am).
